# About this exporter:
This exporter was created for the previous version of FAIMS (v1.0) and in later versions became a core-part of the ‘Generalised Exporter’, the default exporter of the **FAIMS Mobile** server. The exporter outputs geospatial data (points, lines, polygons) in the form of Shapefile, together with associated metadata and relations.

## Authorship:
This exporter was co-developed by Brian Ballsun-Stanton at the FAIMS Project, Department of Ancient History, Macquarie University.

## Funding:
Development of this module was funded by ARC LE140100151, FAIMS: Transforming archaeological research through digital technologies

## Date of release:
2014

## FAIMS Mobile / server version:
FAIMS **v1.0** (Android 4+)

## Licence:

## Access:
This exporter can be downloaded directly from this repository and used on FAIMS **v1.0** server 
1. Clone the repository
1. Create a tarball (tar.gz) of the repository directory ([Do you know how-to-manage a tarball?](https://faimsproject.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MobileUser/pages/54984712/How+to+manage+a+tarball+archive))
1. Upload the tarball to the server through the plugins interface (for details, see below)

## This exporter contains the following features:
* Exports geospatial data as shapefile
* Exports associated metadata and related records

## Exporter Use Recommendations:
* Immediate field use with any module containing geospatial data
* Demonstration and inspiration for other similar customisations

## Contact info:
If you have any questions about the exporter, please contact the FAIMS team at **enquiries@fedarch.org** and we will get back to you within one business day.

## General How-to Info to Exporters 
[*Based on the 'FAIMS User to Developer Documentation' and 'FAIMS Data UI and Logic Cook Book'*](https://www.fedarch.org/support/#3)
To get the data you have collected with the FAIMS Mobile app in a viewable, usable fashion, you'll need to find and download an exporter. An exporter allows you to export data from FAIMS server in many data formats (CSV, shapefile, sqlite database, json etc.). Each exporter has been customised for individual projects, but with none or minor changes it can be reused for other projects.

**How do I make it work?**
* On a PC, you can simply download / clone the file from GitHub. 
* Create a [tarball](https://faimsproject.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MobileUser/pages/54984712/How+to+manage+a+tarball+archive) from the exporter using a program like 7zip; if you're using UNIX, enter something like `tar -czf shapefileExport.tar.gz shapefileExport` 
* Now, if you navigate on the server to your module, you'll see a tab at the top labeled 'Plugin Management'. Click that and you'll be brought to a page with the handy feature, 'Upload Exporter'. Choose the tarball you've just created and hit 'Upload'. You now have an exporter permanently stored to your FAIMS server and may make use of it whenever you'd like.
* From now on, whenever you'd like to use your uploaded exporter, navigate to your module from the main page on the server and click 'Export module'. Select from the dropdown menu the exporter you'd like to use, review and select from any additional options, and click 'Export'.
* You'll be brought to your module's background jobs page while the server exports your data. After a few moments, you should be able to hit 'Refresh' and see a blue hyperlink to 'Export results'. Clicking that will allow you to download your exported data in a compressed file.

**Exporting data doesn't close down the project or prevent you from working any further on it, so feel free to export data whenever it's convenient.**
